## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've used grid a couple times in previous challenges, but this is the first time I've really looked at taking advantage of what it can do. The design only included layouts for mobile and 1440px wide, but I added in something in between in order to keep the experience fluid at any resolution.
