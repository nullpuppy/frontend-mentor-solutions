## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Not much to call out here for learning new things. Most of this was just more adaption of what I've picked up so far. The javascript does something, but isn't really interesting. Hopefully future projects here will do something more.

### Continued development

In future projects I want to continue honing my JS skills. I also want to progress more towards building CSS that will work on older browsers and have a bit more fallback support, as well as adding in progressive enhancements like animations and such.
