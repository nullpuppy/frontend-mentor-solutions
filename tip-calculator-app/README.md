## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This took a little while, mostly because I tried, again, to get it to look as close to the design as possible. It's not pixel perfect, but it's reasonably close. Most of this was pretty easy to throw together, but had to dig into a couple things around events in order to get auto-calculation to work like I wanted it to.

### Continued development

Overall, I'm pretty happy with this solution, though I feel like the javascript could be better.
