## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

As I approach these challenges, I've been discovering just how much has changed since I first ventured into using CSS so many years ago. I've slowly started reading through the official CSS docs while working through layout challenges and some things are finally starting to stick.

### Continued development

In future projects I want to continue to hone semantic HTML5 skills and be more purposeful with my CSS classes, and maybe start focusing on being more general purpose.
