## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The main things I learned in this challenge relate to media queries and furthering my grasp on how flexbox works. I tried to avoid using wrappers for building out the layout for the 4 cards, but I couldn't quite figure out how to stack multiple cards in the same row. I'm sure its possible, and may be something I revisit in the future. The fallback to a single column took some work to figure out, but ultimately was pretty simple to get working.

### Continued development

As mentioned above, I'd like to figure out how to bend flexbox a bit more to my will, and be able to tweak the layout a bit more in pure css without needing wrapper divs and classes.
