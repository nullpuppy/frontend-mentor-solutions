## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my first attempt at building something truly responsive. I tried a few combinations of flexbox and grid before landing on what you see here. Flexbox is used centering the card on the page, and for the content on the right side of the card, and then grid is utilized with media queries to transition from 2 columns to 1 when going to smaller display (or 1 to 2 columns when going from small to large). The relayout feels a little awkward, but it works pretty well.

### Continued development

For future projects I want to continue towards building out more general class names and following semantic html for styling as much as possible. I also want to start looking into animations/transitions.
