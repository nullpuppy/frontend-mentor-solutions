## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

What I learned in this challenge is that I have a lot more still to learn. I'm getting more comfortable and getting a better feel of how to organize things. More to do, but this felt ok. I also tried to start using more semantic HTML5 markup to organize the content and rely, at least some, on the raw elements without needing additional classes.

### Continued development

In future projects I want to continue to hone semantic HTML5 skills and be more purposeful with my CSS classes, and maybe start focusing on being more general purpose.
