## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was, again, mostly just applying what I've already learned and know. I did have lookup a few minor js things to get filtering elements working right, but there's not much interesting to call out there.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to work towards making the js a bit better organized and more resilient, and continue improving my general CSS skills.

The display on this project is static, but I'd like to explore more variable sorting/filtering methods for displaying data as well. And perhaps look at more dynamically building and displaying the data (like the tile headers to be driven by remote data instead of shoving the "remote" data into the defined html).
