  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my first time really doing any form validation. What's here is pretty minimal, but I think it's a good foundation. Actual production code will be a bit more rigorous.

I experimented a little with transitions. They look pretty great on chrome, but don't seem to work at all on firefox. I want to investigate that more in the future, but it's not critical for completion of this project, so it's just on the backlog now of something I might look at in the future.

### Continued development

Not much to say, just looking forward to doing something a bit more meaty with javascript, and maybe more animations and other graphical candy in css.
